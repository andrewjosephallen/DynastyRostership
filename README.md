# How to Run This Python App

In this guide, you'll learn how to run the Python app, provide a username, and retrieve the generated file. Let's take it step-by-step, keeping it simple for those new to the command line.

## Step 1: Find the App's Location

1. **Locate the App's Folder**
   - Open your file explorer (Windows Explorer on Windows, Finder on macOS).

2. **Copy the Path to the App's Folder**
   - Once you're in the correct folder, click on the address bar at the top of the file explorer window.
   - This will show the full path to the folder. Copy this path to your clipboard (Ctrl + C on Windows, Cmd + C on macOS).

## Step 2: Open a Terminal or Command Prompt

1. **Open the Command Line Interface**
   - On Windows, press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press `Enter` to open Command Prompt.
   - On macOS, open Terminal from Applications > Utilities or use Spotlight (Cmd + Space, then type "Terminal").

2. **Navigate to the App's Folder**
   - In the command line, type `cd ` (with a space), then paste the path you copied earlier. To paste, use Ctrl + V on Windows or Cmd + V on macOS.
   - Press `Enter`. You should now be in the correct directory.

## Step 3: Run `main.py`

1. **Ensure Python Is Installed**
   - Type `python --version` to ensure Python is installed and accessible.
   - If you get an error, you'll need to install Python (refer to our Python installation guide).

2. **Run the App**
   - With the terminal open and in the correct directory, type:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
   - Press `Enter` to run the app.

## Step 4: Enter a Username

1. **Provide Your Username**
   - After running the app, you'll be asked to enter a username.
   - Type your desired username and press `Enter`.

## Step 5: Find the Generated File

1. **Wait for the App to Complete**
   - The app will generate a file and will tell you the file's name.
   
2. **Locate the Output File**
   - The generated file is usually saved in the same folder as `main.py`.
   - Return to your file explorer and find the file in that folder.
